# **About Dockyard**

Dockyard is an open-source desktop application that unifies all your favourite web tools into one flexible workspace.
It’s designed for creators, developers, and productivity junkies who want total control over how they organise and interact with their digital environment — without handing over data or control to a proprietary platform.

## 🧭 **Philosophy**

Modern workflows are fragmented across dozens of browser tabs and apps.
Rambox, Station, and others tried to solve this but often became bloated, closed-source, or subscription-bound.

Dockyard is built on three principles:

1. **Freedom** – You decide what runs, how it runs, and where your data lives.
2. **Flexibility** – Every user should be able to shape their workspace to match their habits, not the other way around.
3. **Focus** – Tools should stay out of your way. Dockyard hibernates idle apps, reduces clutter, and keeps attention sharp.

## ⚙️ **Core Concepts**

### **Profiles**

Each profile is an independent workspace environment — like having multiple browsers.
You can run separate Dockyard instances simultaneously (e.g., one for work, one for personal use).

### **Workspaces**

A workspace is a group of apps centred around a goal — design, writing, dev, marketing, etc.
It helps you keep related apps in one organised view, share sessions selectively, and switch contexts instantly.

### **Apps**

Dockyard ships with a curated collection of popular web apps and lets you add your own custom URLs.
Each app can have multiple instances (perfect for managing multiple accounts) and can be grouped or tiled as you wish.

### **Customisation**

You decide everything — icon placement, theme colour, layout, and behaviour.
Dockyard is designed to _adapt to you_, not the other way around.

### **Performance**

Apps can automatically hibernate after a user-defined period to save memory.
Essential apps stay awake, while the rest quietly nap until needed.

## 🔍 **Why It Matters**

In a world where every “productivity” tool wants to track you, sync you, and sell you a subscription, Dockyard brings back simplicity and ownership.
It’s a **privacy-first**, **local-first**, and **developer-friendly** workspace — no telemetry, no ads, no dark patterns.

You can run it offline, customise everything, or even fork it to build your own variant.
Dockyard belongs to its users, not a corporation.

## 🧑‍💻 **Built For Builders**

Dockyard is being developed as a transparent, modular, hackable project.
If you can write JavaScript, TypeScript, or React, you can contribute new features, app templates, or UI themes.

## 💬 **In a Sentence**

> **Dockyard** is the open, local-first alternative to Rambox — designed for hackers, creators, and deep thinkers who want to take back control of their digital workspace.
