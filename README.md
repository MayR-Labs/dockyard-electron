# **Dockyard**

*A flexible, open-source multi-app workspace built for power users.*

Dockyard lets you bring all your favourite web apps into one elegant desktop hub. Switch, tile, and manage them like browser tabs on steroids — all while keeping sessions isolated, notifications flowing, and your workspace tidy.

---

## 🚀 **Features at a Glance**

* Multiple profiles (run separate instances of the app)
* Workspaces for grouping related apps
* Add unlimited built-in or custom apps
* Multiple instances per app (e.g., two GitHub accounts)
* Session isolation and shared session options
* Auto-hibernation and performance controls
* Notifications and per-app badges
* Customisable layout (icons on top, left, right, or bottom)
* Full theme control with light/dark and accent colours
* Offline-first local persistence
* Cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux)

## 🧠 **Why Dockyard Exists**

Most “all-in-one” messaging and productivity containers are either bloated, proprietary, or subscription-locked. Dockyard flips that model: it’s **open, hackable, and locally managed.**
No logins, no cloud sync — just your setup, your data, your workflow.

---

## 🧩 **Tech Stack**

* **Electron** — desktop shell
* **Vite + React** — frontend UI
* **TypeScript** — strong typing for maintainability
* **electron-store / lowdb** — local persistence
* **TailwindCSS** — styling system
* **Framer Motion** — smooth transitions and animations
