## The Problem (Why Dockyard Exists)

### Current Frustrations

**Too Many Tabs**
Managing dozens of browser tabs across Gmail, Slack, Notion, Figma, and more is chaotic. You lose track of which app is where, waste time switching, and deal with constant browser crashes.

**Existing Solutions Are Broken**
Apps like Rambox, Station, and Franz promise to solve this, but they:
- Lock features behind expensive subscriptions
- Track your usage and send data to their servers
- Require cloud accounts and syncing
- Come with bloat and features you don't need
- Use proprietary, closed-source code you can't audit

**Privacy Is Compromised**
Most "productivity" tools want your data. They track what you do, when you do it, and sync everything to their servers. You're the product, not the customer.

## The Solution (What Dockyard Offers)

### Freedom & Control

**Completely Open Source**
Every line of code is auditable. No hidden tracking, no secret data collection. Fork it, modify it, make it yours.

**Privacy-First Architecture**
All your data stays on your machine. No cloud sync, no accounts, no telemetry. Your workspaces, your apps, your data — locally stored and encrypted.

**Free Forever**
No subscriptions, no paywalls, no "pro" plans. Every feature is available to everyone, always. MIT licensed.

### Powerful Features, Zero Compromise

**Profiles & Workspaces**
Create separate profiles for work, personal, and side projects. Each profile can have multiple workspaces to group related apps.

**Session Isolation**
Every app runs in its own isolated session by default. Run multiple Gmail accounts, multiple Slack workspaces, or multiple GitHub profiles — all side by side.

**Auto-Hibernation**
Idle apps automatically hibernate to save memory. Your machine stays fast, even with 20+ apps loaded.

**Full Customization**
Choose light or dark themes, customize accent colors, position your dock anywhere, and even inject custom CSS/JS into individual apps.

## Core Values

### Privacy
Your data is yours. We never collect, track, or transmit anything. No analytics, no crash reports, no "anonymous" usage data. True privacy-first design.

### Freedom
Open source means you're never locked in. Don't like something? Change it. Want to add a feature? Fork it. The code belongs to the community.

### Simplicity
We don't add features for the sake of features. Every element serves a purpose. The UI gets out of your way so you can focus on your work.

### Performance
Dockyard is lightweight and fast. Auto-hibernation, efficient memory management, and optimized rendering keep your machine running smoothly.

## The Dockyard Philosophy

> **"Software should serve you, not surveil you."**

We believe that:
- **Privacy is not optional** — it's a fundamental right
- **Open source is transparent** — no hidden agendas
- **Local-first is liberating** — your data shouldn't live on someone else's server
- **Customization is empowering** — one size doesn't fit all
- **Performance matters** — software should be fast and efficient

## Technical Foundation

- **Electron** - Cross-platform desktop framework
- **React** - Fast, component-based UI
- **TypeScript** - Type safety and maintainability
- **Vite** - Lightning-fast development builds
- **TailwindCSS** - Beautiful, responsive design

### Secure by Design

## Development Approach

### Transparent Roadmap
All development is tracked publicly on GitHub. See what's coming, what's in progress, and what's been completed.

### Community-Driven
Feature requests, bug reports, and contributions are welcomed. We build what users need, not what investors demand.

### Quality Over Speed
We don't rush releases. Each phase is thoroughly tested, documented, and polished before moving forward.

## The Story Behind Dockyard

Dockyard was born from frustration. The founder was tired of juggling browser tabs, paying monthly fees for basic features, and wondering what data was being collected by proprietary workspace apps.

After trying Rambox, Station, and Franz, the problems were clear:
- Subscription fatigue
- Privacy concerns
- Closed-source black boxes
- Feature bloat

So Dockyard was built — not as a startup, not to make money, but as a tool for people who value **privacy, freedom, and control**.

It's maintained by [MayR Labs](https://github.com/MayR-Labs) and supported by a growing community of contributors who believe software should respect its users.

## Join the Movement

Dockyard isn't just an app — it's a statement that privacy-first, user-controlled software is possible and desirable.
